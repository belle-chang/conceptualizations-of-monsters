            According to an anonymous writer in the American Periodicals Series II in 1825 and to put it simply: “Among the Chinese, the anticipations of death are distressing”. [1] The Afterlife was a gruesome scene to the Chinese and any step out of line was sure to be looked after and punished for. Depending on your belief system, after you died, you were either sent to the 18 levels of Hell or the Buddhism-influenced 10 Courts of Hell, and neither typically had any scenic stops you would want to stop and look at.  
          </p>
          <p>
            In each layer or court, souls are punished for the faults they made when they were alive. In “Calling Home the Soul of the Dead” written by Sung Yu in 290 B.C., souls were warned not to travel to the lower regions of the world and into the Diyu where “the king of demons whose fingers were dripping with human blood was chasing souls to devour them”. [2] In the 18 Levels of Hell, each level had an assigned punishment to give to the assigned crime of the level and the lower you descend into the Diyu, the more heinous the crime the soul committed in his or her time on Earth. The sinners feel all of the pain and agony just like as if they were living humans; however, they can not “die” from the torture because when the torture is over, their bodies are restored to their original form and then are tortured again. According to Xiao Dengfu in his book Conceptions of "Hell" in the Han, Wei and Six Dynasties and in order from just below the surface of the world to the deepest parts of the Diyu, here are the 18 Levels of Hell:

            However, according to Buddhist traditional thought, the Diyu is seen as a purgatory that serves to punish and renew spirits in preparation for reincarnation. Thus, the 10 Courts of Hell were created: a subterranean maze with various courts to which souls are taken after death to make up for the sins they committed when they were alive and their finish line is to gain the approval of the last “Yama” king to continue their journey towards reincarnation. In Buddhist mythology, the word Yama is descriptive of a wrathful god who is said to judge the dead, preside over Hell, and look after the cycle of the afterlife. [3] Much like the different levels in the non-religious, more traditional Hell interpretation, each of the courts in the 10 Courts of Hell version of the Diyu center around a particular crime or sin the soul committed when they were alive on Earth. But differing from the Levels, the Courts’ end to their punishments are all decided on by the King of the Court, but until the King of the Court allows the soul to pass, they are to continuously be tortured. 
          </p>
          <p>
            According to M. Kennelley SJ in his book <em>Researches into Chinese Superstitions</em>, these are how the 10 Yama Courts are depicted in Buddhist tradition: 
          </p>

                <li>
                  King Qinguang differentiates the good from the evil by rigorously assessing past deeds
                </li>
                <li>
                  The good and the virtuous then cross over a golden bridge to reach paradise, while the wicked are dragged to face a magical mirror to confirm their sins
                </li>
                <li>
                  This is the one of the two courts of hell that do not execute any punishments

                  <u>Corrupted officers, burglars, and compulsive gamblers</u> are thrown into an icy cavern to suffer freezing torment

                <li>

          <p>
            We can see that the two versions of the Diyu have many similarities - both punish intensely for mostly the same crimes. For example, both versions punish gossipers by ripping out their tongues; but, for some crimes like arson, it is true that arson is punished in both realms, however, they use different tactics. In the Levels, arson is punished by being tied to a burning copper pole, but in the Courts, arson is punished by being stripped down and dismembered. We also see that the same torture tactics are used but for different crimes in the different realms. For example, in the Levels, the reason why one would be hung on iron trees is because they broke apart either their own or someone else’s family, but in the Courts, the reason why one would be hung on iron trees or “skewered on a tree of knives” is because they were cheaters, foul-mouth individuals, or kidnappers.

            This connection shows that many of the traditional thoughts of what should and shouldn’t be punished in society stayed much the same, even to this day.

          >Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
