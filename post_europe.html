          <p>European imaginations of hell are often embodied by imagery of destruction, fire, and darkness. Virgil, a poet who composed <em>The Aeneid</em> describes hell as a:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">...vast cave deep in the gaping, jagged rock, shielded well by a dusky lake and shadowed grove 
            / over it no bird on earth could make its way unscathed, such poisonous vapors steamed up from its dark throat to cloud the arching sky.
            <div class="text-right" style="padding-right: 10%;">– The Aeneid, page 23</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>The description of Virgil's version of hell follows in line with the traditional European understanding of the landscape - the 
            <strong>gaping, jagged rock</strong>, <strong>dusky lake</strong>, <strong>shadowed grove</strong>, and <strong>dark sky</strong>
            point to Hell being a place of gloominess, devastation, and misery.
          </p> 
          
          <p>Similarly, the <em>Bible's</em> rendition of the underworld holds a similar concept to that of Virgil's in Greek mythology with the notion of the
            <strong>Sheol</strong>. The Sheol was a prison-like place of darkness where souls abided in silence and forgetfulness, 
            and it was often reserved for the wicked and impious. 
          </p>

          <!-- <p>
            Additionally, punishment in the Sheol was also often at the hands of fire. The <em>Bible</em> captures the moment of __ witnessing a punishment by 
          </p> -->
        
          <p>
            The landscape in the Sheol is also characterized by fire and darkness, with "the burning river of fire" (<em>The Bible</em>, page 38), in which
            men and women are sunken at different levels depending on their crimes, as well as "the pits great in depth...the abyss has no end, for beyond [it] 
            follows what lies beneath it" (<em>The Bible</em>, page 39), where the dead
            are forced to lump together to beg for forgiveness.
          </p>  

          <p>
            The best imagination of hell, however, is from the early 14th century work by Dante, <em>The Divine Comedy</em>. In the first book, <em>The Inferno</em>, Dante
            describes the chronicle of his journey through hell, in which he describes it as a deep funnel with circular tiers and bounded at the bottom 
            by a frozen lake known Cocytus in which a 3 faced Satan resides. Similarly to Virgil and <em>The Bible's</em> rendition of hell,
            Dante's is full of suffering, anger, negativity, and darkness. Upon entering the gates of hell, one will experience:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">Sighs and groans and plaintive wailing...diverse tongues, horrible dialects, words of agony, accents of anger
            <div class="text-right" style="padding-right: 10%;">– Inferno, page __</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Next, entering the "filthy fen," he witnesses:
          </p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">...people caked with mud in that lagoon, all of them naked and fierce. They struck one another not only with their hands, but their heads and bodies and feet, tearing each other to pieces with their teeth.
            <div class="text-right" style="padding-right: 10%;">– Inferno, page __</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Dante then describes the "boiling blood", "forest of suicides", and "trapped under ice":
          </p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            River of blood, draws near, within boils whoever did injury to others by violence...
            Foliage was not green, but dark in color, the branches were not smooth but gnarled and tangled. There were no apple trees, but only thorns with poison...
            All shades were completely trapped in ie; their shapes glimmered through like straws in a glass. This is the place where you must arm yourself with fortitude...
            <div class="text-right" style="padding-right: 10%;">– Inferno, page __</div>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Clearly, Dante's imaginings of hell follow the same formula as first described -- the description of <strong>sighs, groans, plaintive wailing</strong>, cannibalistic destruction of each others'
            flesh, <strong>river of blood</strong> that boils those who have violently harmed others, the forest of trees with <strong>only thorns of poison</strong>, and the figures <strong>completely trapped in ice</strong> all point to how each circle is
            encompassed by suffering, retribution, and misery. 
          </p>

          <p>The more comprehensive figure below delves deeper into Dante's description of the 9 circles of hell, each circle complete with a punishment fit for the sin:</p>

          <!-- <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

          <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

          <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
